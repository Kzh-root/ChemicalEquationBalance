# ChemicalEquationBalance

Welcome here. This project is the subject of our research study: Programming Implementation of Matrix-Based Balance of Chemical Equations.

Currently, this project has been awarded the first prize by the school.

The code for this project is under /code and the paper is under /paper. Visitors can get further results of our project on the basis of predecessors from the paper, and the details involved in the paper have been implemented in the code.

However, this project has only completed its original vision. In fact, it still has a lot of room for expansion and improvement.

You are welcome to improve this project, point out deficiencies, and make suggestions!

欢迎来到这里。这个项目是我们的研究性学习的课题：基于矩阵的化学方程式配平的编程实现。

目前，这个项目被学校评为一等奖。

这个项目的代码在 /code 下，论文在 /paper 下。Visitors 可以从论文中得到我们这个项目的在前人基础上的进一步的成果，并且，论文中所涉及的细节等等都已在代码中得到实现。

但是，这个项目只是完成了它最初的设想，其实，它还有许多的扩充进步空间。

欢迎各位神犇大牛完善这个项目，指出不足、提出建议！
